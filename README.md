# World Model experiments

Based on [World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10122)

- Using feature loss rather than pixel loss. Yields much sharper reconstructions
- Using AWD-LSTM rather than vanilla lstm allows us to use much bigger model w/out overfitting
- Using MDN as described

Code still in exploratory state.
